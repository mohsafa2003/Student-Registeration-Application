Student Registeration app.
-
This project serves as an example and as a protfolio project.

It's developed in C#. 

In this project you're able to add the students informtion such as:
   -
    - Student's Name.
    - Student's Gender.
    - Residence.
    - Phone Number.
    - Date Of Birth.
    - Class/Year.
    - Major.

Important details:
-
For now you're unable to save any of this information in a database since the program itself isn't linked to any so basically whenever you exit the project and re-open it all the data is gone (This will hopefully be temporarily) .
but the information given can be stored in a table and can be viewed also the students can have a unique ID that identifies each student , I'll be working on saving and other features like customization as I go!
